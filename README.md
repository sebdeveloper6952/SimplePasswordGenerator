# SimplePasswordGenerator

Hello!

I am Sebastian, currently on my first semester studying Systems Engineering. This is my first project. We all know that the vast majority 
of passwords are based on dictionary words.
The purpose of Simple Password Generator is to create a good password habit on the user. This is done by generating a password with a 
random combination of characters. The user specifies which characters to include, and the password length. 

We will add an alarm system to make the user change his password every certain amount of time. The user will also specify this time period.
