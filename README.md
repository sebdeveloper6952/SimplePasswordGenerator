# SimplePasswordGenerator

Hello!

I am Sebastian, currently on my first semester studying Systems Engineering. This is my first project. We all know that the vast majority of passwords are based on dictionary words.

Simple Password Generator is an Android app which purpose is to create a good password habit on the user. This is done by generating a password with a random combination of characters. The user specifies which characters to include, and the password length. 

We will add an alarm system to make the user change his password every certain amount of time. The user will also specify this time period.

Of course, the user has to manually change his passwords on his accounts to actually make a difference. Maybe they will...
